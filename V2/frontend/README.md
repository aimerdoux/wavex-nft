6. Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Design Decisions

- Used Next.js 13 with App Router for modern React features and better SEO
- Implemented Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistent styling
- Used Zustand for simple and efficient state management
- Created reusable components for NFT cards and UI elements
- Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Added Web3 integration with MetaMask for blockchain interactions

## Notes

- The frontend is currently using mock data for NFTs and user information
- Web3 integration is prepared but needs contract address configuration
- Environment variables need to be set before deployment
- Some features like search and filtering are prepared in UI but need backend integration
