   - [ ] USDC transactions
   - [ ] Balance updates
   - [ ] Payment processing
   - [ ] Top-up functionality

3. Event System
   - [ ] Event creation
   - [ ] Event purchase
   - [ ] Capacity management
   - [ ] Event type validation

4. Merchant Operations
   - [ ] Merchant authorization
   - [ ] Transaction processing
   - [ ] Merchant revocation
   - [ ] Transaction history

## Known Issues

1. Template Initialization
   - Current issue with template balances (needs to be updated to 1000 USD for Gold and 3000 USD for Platinum)
   - Initialization requires proper pause/unpause handling

2. Gas Optimization
   - Some operations might need gas limit adjustments
   - Transaction batching could be improved

## Future Development Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Update Template Values
   ```javascript
   // Update in initializeDefaultTemplates()
   _addTemplate(1, "Gold", 1000 * 10**18, 1000 * 10**18, 0, false, "", true);
   _addTemplate(2, "Platinum", 3000 * 10**18, 3000 * 10**18, 0, false, "", true);
   ```

2. Testing Sequence
   ```bash
   # 1. Deploy contract
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/deployV2.js --network polygonAmoy

   # 2. Verify templates
   npx hardhat run scripts/templates/listTemplates.js --network polygonAmoy

   # 3. Setup tokens
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/setupTokens.js --network polygonAmoy

   # 4. Setup merchants
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy/setupMerchants.js --network polygonAmoy

   # 5. Run system tests
   npx hardhat run scripts/test/runTests.js --network polygonAmoy
   ```

### Long-term Improvements
1. Smart Contract
   - Implement batch operations for gas optimization
   - Add more event types and template variations
   - Enhance security measures

2. Testing Framework
   - Develop comprehensive unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Implement automated testing pipeline

3. Documentation
   - Create API documentation
   - Add deployment guides
   - Document testing procedures

## Development Guidelines

### Error Prevention
1. Always verify contract state before operations:
   - Check if contract is paused/unpaused
   - Verify template existence
   - Confirm merchant authorization

2. Gas Management:
   - Use appropriate gas limits for different operations
   - Monitor gas costs for batch operations
   - Implement gas optimization strategies

3. Testing Protocol:
   - Test on local network first
   - Verify on testnet before mainnet
   - Document all test results

### Deployment Process
1. Pre-deployment:
   - Verify all environment variables
   - Check network configuration
   - Validate contract parameters

2. Deployment:
   - Deploy contract
   - Initialize templates
   - Setup tokens
   - Configure merchants

3. Post-deployment:
   - Verify all functions
   - Document deployed addresses
   - Update configuration files

## Future Development Prompt

For future development sessions, consider the following:

1. Contract Upgrades:
```solidity
// Implement upgradeable contracts
// Add new features like:
- Dynamic pricing
- Automated events
- Enhanced security measures
```

2. Testing Requirements:
```javascript
// Implement comprehensive testing:
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for workflows
- Gas optimization tests
```

3. Documentation Needs:
```markdown
# Required Documentation:
- API references
- Integration guides
- Security considerations
```
